Prime Sum
 Accept a number N up to 5 digits long in the positional numeral system formed by symbols 0, 1, ... 9, A, ..., Z. Also, accept another symbol S other than zero.

Considering N to be represented in the least base possible between 2 and 36, identify the smallest prime number greater than  N that contains at least one occurrence of S in it in base S + 1.

(Refer example section for a better understanding). Prime number should be identified with respect to Base 10 i.e. a regular prime number.

Constraints
Length of N <= 5
Max Base = 36
Face values for symbols:
Symbol => Value in base 10

0 => 0

1 => 1

2 => 2

….

9 => 9

A => 10

B => 11

….

Z => 35

Input Format
First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains:
One line containing two integers, N and S separated with space.
Output
Print the smallest prime number greater than or equal to N that contains at least one occurrence of S in it, in base S + 1.
Example Test Case 1
2
10 B
ZZ Z
Output
B
11Z
Explanation 1
The least possible base for N is 2 and its value in that base is 2. We want the smallest prime number in base 12 (1 more than the face value of B, 11) that contains symbol B and is greater than or equal to 2. The first few numbers in ascending order in base 12 containing face value B are B (value 11), 1B (value 1 * 12 + 11 = 23), 2B (value 2 * 12 + 11 = 35): of these the smallest number that is prime is 11, which is greater than N. Hence, the output is B.

Explanation 2
The least possible base for N is 36 and its value in that base is 35 * 36 ^1 + 35 = 1295. The first few numbers in ascending order in base 36 (1 more than the face value of Z, 35) containing face value Z and greater than N are 10Z (1 * 36^2 + 0*36^1 + 35 = 1331, non-prime), 11Z (1 * 36^2 + 1 * 36^1 + 35 = 1367, a prime). Hence, the output is 11Z.
